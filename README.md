# BMI-Calc
A simple CLI BMI calculator.


# To Run
To run the program, make sure that you first have python 3.x installed on your computer, you can find out how to do this at https://www.python.org/
Next, just double click the program to run it.
A command promt should pop up asking for which measurement system you would like to use (Imperial or Metric).
Then, type in your weight (It has to be in numbers, not words).
Finally, type in your height (This also has to be in numbers, and not in words) and you're all good to go.
It should tell you your BMI afterwards.

# Future Updates
I plan on making some future updates including a scale to tell you where you are (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, etc.).
I will also be working on making it a GUI instead of a CLI to make it easier for users.
The last thing that I would like to add, is compiling the source code into an executable to make it easier for the everyday Joe to use.
